# Armur-Code-Scanner

This is the official repository for the Armur static scanner built with GO. It uses the best open source tools for static scanning and combines them in a pipeline. It works amazingly for languages like GO, Rust and Python.

This was built after talking to hundreds of Red Teamers, Bug Bounty hunters, security researchers and most importantly, developers to build a solution that automates a huge part of the work required to find security issues and vulnerabilities in code.

Visit www.armur.ai to use the cloud based version of this same tool.

On the Armur platform, you can use our proprietary AI tool that uses Agents powered by LLMs for security tooling that help provide extremely detailed reports on code security for GO, Python and Rust code and smart contracts code for Solidity, Move and Solana (Rust) - on blockchains
